This application represents a school managing system that offers Students and Teachers different desirable options.
Students can enroll for a course, display courses with free spots or courses without any student enrolled. 
Teachers can display students that take a course, delete a course, change the number of credits for a course, 
sort students by their first name and filter students according to their number of credits.
A simple JavaFX GUI is used to make the application more attractive.
